# Foundry UX Improvement Bundle

This module isn't really a module. It's just a bunch of dependencies as a way to bundle up a lot of recommended modules in one. Each of these in the bundle have been tested on 0.6.6 to not have conflicts with eachother and were judged to have a low surface area for conflicting with other modules/systems out there.

Most of these speak for themsevles, below are the elevator pitch versions of their descriptions, as well as links to the module pages.

## Bundle Installation

Theoretically, just add this module to your installation and it will prompt you to install all dependencies.

## Honorable Mentions

These are some modules that are very useful in the same vein as this list, but have more opportunity for conflict and thus weren't included.

- [Laptop Form Fix](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/laptop-fix/) - Lots of tweaks to the UI to allow it to work on smaller laptop screens, high surface area for conflicts with other UI-involved modules.

- [Pings](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/pings/) - A familiar concept for Roll20 users, Pings allows players to click and hold to draw attention to an area. It also has the option to bring all users' screens to a spot.
